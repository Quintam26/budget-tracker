Budget Tracker App

This app allows users to manage their finances by keeping track of their money.

Users have the ability to create a "Category" that requires the name and budget of said category.

For example, I created a Category named Car with a budget of $5000.

Each created Category is displayed in a list and each category can have its name and budget upted or deleted completely:

Categories:

car has a budget of $5000✎🗑

bike has a budget of $100✎🗑

pc has a budget of $800✎🗑
